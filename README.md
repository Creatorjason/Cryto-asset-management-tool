## Brief
Given the requirements for building this tool, I opted to apply a functional programming paradigm where I encapsulated program logic into functions which were able to simplify, increase reusability and interoperability between the various components (modules) of the project.
In other to make the program function as optimally and reliable as a live program would, that handles live data, I implored the use of asynchronous code (Promises) so as to keep the individual and distinct parts of program running smoothly.
I also took into account user experience as I ensured that the target audience are able to use the program in their preferred language of choice, this program currently supports Chinese(Simplified), Tamil, Malay and English to account for a better user experience.
